# Liten CTF for rebusen p√• Ettermiddagen@IFI
- made a CTF for students who study programming and informatics at the University of Oslo
- A simple challenge, oarticipants must find the qr codes that give them ciphertext and clues
- ciphertexts are to be decrypted with cyberchef.io
- made lots of files so that people parcicipating will have a hard time guessing where the ciphertexts are hidden, if they find them selves cheating by looking at my repo mohahahahah
- the relevant files are 1, 3, 16, 420, 5000

Enjoy the hunt and happy decrypting!
