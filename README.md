# Liten CTF for rebusen p√• Ettermiddagen@IFI
- made a CTF for students who study programming and intformatics at the University of Oslo
- A simple challenge, where that must find the qr codes that give them ciphertext and clues
- ciphertexts are to be decrypted with cyberchef.io
- made lots of files so that people parcicipating will have a hard time guessing where the ciphertexts are hidden, if they find them selves cheating by looking at my repo mohahahahah

Enjoy the hunt and happy decrypting!
